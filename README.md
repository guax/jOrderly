jOrderly
========

This is an Orderly JSON parser and validator in Java.

Its being implemented as part of a conclusion project to the course of Information
Systems at the Fedederal University Of Santa Catarina - Brazil.

WARNING
=======

This is a work in progress and can do very little.

For now it can read Orderly documents and use it to barely validate JSON data.
