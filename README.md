jOrderly
========

This is an Orderly JSON parser and validator in Java.

Its being implemented as part of a conclusion project to the course of Information
Systems at the Fedederal University Of Santa Catarina - Brazil.

WARNING
=======

This is a work in progress and can do very little.

For now it can read Orderly documents and use it to validate JSON data. And that is
pretty much everything it will do for now. Some changes might be made to acquire object
structures from valid json objects but thats not the current scope of the project.
